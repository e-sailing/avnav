    <h2><a id="Intro" name="Intro"></a>Introduction</h2>
    <img title="Karten" alt="Karten" src="Karten.png" width="600">
    <p>To use charts in AvNav they have to be available in a tile format. This
      is a format used by services like OpenStreetMaps or GoogleMaps. A tile has
      (normally) a size of 256x256 pixel. The world is projected to a flat
      surface (imagine a paper cylinder wrapped around the earth at the
      aequator). Each point with it's coordinates (longitude/latitude) will pe
      projected at this cylinder. How this is performed in detail, which units
      will be used and whether the earth is considered as an ellipsoid or a
      sphere is described by the projection. AvNav is using the so called google
      mercator projection (earth considered a sphere) with the EPSG code 900913.
      The projected units are always meters (but can be converted to longitude
      and latitude). If you have charts using a different projection they have
      to be reprojected beforehand.</p>
    <p>The whole projection area is split into tiles. The zoom level determines
      the number of tiles for the complete area. Zoom level 0 means:&nbsp;
      complete earth (from -85°...+85°, outside these limits the projection is
      undefined) is shown in one tile of 256x256 pixel. With each other level
      there will be more tiles - level 1: 2x2 tiles, level 2: 4x4 tiles. The
      most relevant zoom levels for our usage typically range from 7 to 18..19.
      That means at level 19:2^19x2^19 tiles.<br>
      The <a href="http://www.openlayers.org/">openlayers</a> library is used
      to display the charts. This library loads the tiles based on zoom level
      from the server (raspberry) and displays them on the screen. It is often
      used in OpenStreatMap applications.<br>
      You can easily imagine the huge numbers of tiles required for higher zoom
      levels (if you try e.g. zoom 19 for all). Therefore it makes sense to
      follow the same approach we take for paper charts: for an overview a small
      zoom level is used, detail charts a bit more and e.g. port approaches with
      the highest levels 18 or 19 (60cm/pixel and 30cm/pixel). To still maintain
      a nice display experience the different detail levels can overlay the
      other tiles of less detail. If there is a better (higher) zoomlevel for an
      area this one will be displayed - otherwise the one with a lower zoom
      level (potentially up scaled). To not overload the display devices, the
      number of layers should be limited to 3...5 (depending on the device). </p>
    <p>For chart conversion the goal is to assign available charts to such
      layers, to potentially reproject them and finally create the chart tiles
      (maybe together with a description). Typically this requires a lot of
      computing power (and time) and should be better run on a desktop system.
      But typically this should be no problem as you will do this only once.
      After you will be rewarded with a continous chart view with no gaps
      inbetween.<br>
      The same has to be considered when it comes to downloading charts. You
      need to carefully select areas and zoom levels. </p>
    <p>The download procedure depends on the source. I currently support 2
      options to create charts for AvNav:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Converting charts using <a href="http://www.gdal.org/">GDAL</a>
          (like BSB) – you can use everything that GDAL can read</p>
      </li>
      <li> Downloading charts using the <a href="http://mobac.sourceforge.net/">Mobile
          Atlas Creator</a>. </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
    </ul>
    <h2><a name="chartformats" id="chartformats"></a>Chart Formats</h2>
    <p>AvNav uses <a href="http://www.cgtk.co.uk/gemf">GEMF</a> as its primary
      format. It is a compact binary format merging all tiles into one file with
      the necessary meta data added. This format permits special functions like
      automatic zoom level adaptation.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
      Since version 20200325 AvNav can directly use the <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/MBTiles">mbtiles</a>
      format. To use this format you potentially have to select the correct
      variant of internal tile sorting. The default format is "xyz" but there is
      also a "tms" format available. You can switch the format at the <a href="userdoc/downloadpage.html#mbtiles">Files/Download</a>
      page. You can download MbTiles directly e.g. from <a href="https://ftp.gwdg.de/pub/misc/openstreetmap/openseamap/charts/mbtiles/">OpenSeamap</a>.</p>
    <p><b>Hint</b>: Up to version 202011xx AvNav was reading an entry "scheme"
      in the mbtiles metadata. Unfortunately the usage of this entry is not well
      defined and different sources are using differently (see <a href="https://github.com/wellenvogel/avnav/issues/63">Issue
        #63</a>). In earlier editions AvNav internally inverted the meaning of
      xyz and tms. Since version 202011xx AvNav ignores this value (and assumes
      tms). If the value is set in the metadata, the chart will be displayed in
      red and you can visit the <a href="userdoc/downloadpage.html">Download-Page</a>
      to choose the type to be applied for this specific chart.</p>
    <p>Additionally (since 20200325) you can also use online chart sources,
      provided they support the default url format. You have to configure this
      with an xml file. An example can be found in the provided <a href="https://github.com/wellenvogel/avnav/blob/master/viewer/demo/osm-online.xml">online
        source for OpenSeaMap</a>.</p>
    <p>Since version 20200515 you can use a <a href="hints/ocharts.html">plugin</a>
      to process charts from <a href="https://o-charts.org/">o-charts</a> as
      well.</p>
    <p>Since version 202011xx you can use charts from the <a href="https://github.com/SignalK/charts-plugin">signalK
        chart provider</a> &nbsp; (if the <a href="hints/CanboatAndSignalk.html#SignalK">signalK
        integration</a> is active).</p>
    <p>With the <a href="#mapproxy">MapProxy Plugin</a> you can utilize and
      download charts from various online chart sources.</p>
    <h2><a name="installation" id="installation"></a>Installation of Charts</h2>
    <p>After installing AvNav there is one/a couple of online demo charts
      available. For real usage you have to install charts in AvNav.<br>
      You can do this either by directly copying charts into the chart directory
      (/home/pi/avnav/data/charts) or&nbsp; to the external chart directory on
      android. You can also upload the charts directly within the WebApp (some
      only starting from 20200325). Upload can be executed via the <a href="userdoc/downloadpage.html#chartupload">Files/Download
        page</a>.<br>
      For android you have to consider that mbtiles can only be handled after
      explicit upload&nbsp; - instead of simply storing them in the external
      chart directory.<br>
      For mbtiles consider the option to switch the internal scheme <a href="userdoc/downloadpage.html#mbtiles">at
        the Files/Download page</a> .</p>
    <p>In standard versions (not android) starting from 20200325 you can also
      upload charts that still require conversion. The converter as described
      in&nbsp; <a href="#Convert">Converting</a> is always included in AvNav.
      It will read files from it's import directory (/home/pi/avnav/data/import)
      or from sub directories. When <a href="userdoc/downloadpage.html#chartupload">uploading</a>
      a file with a known filename extension (like .kap) you will be asked if
      you want this file to be loaded to the converter import directory. You can
      monitor the working state of the importer at the <a href="userdoc/statuspage.html">status
        page</a>. You should keep in mind that converting requires a lot of CPU
      power and can last for hours on the raspberry pi. Probably it is more
      efficient to run this on a desktop system.</p>
    <p>If the <a href="#mapproxy">MapProxy plugin</a> is installed its charts
      will directly become visible in AvNav without any further installation. </p>
    <h2><a name="overlays" id="overlays"></a>Overlays</h2>
    <p>Since version 20201219 AvNav can display further information as overlay
      (or underlay). You can as well combine different charts. </p>
    <p>For details see <a href="hints/overlays.html">Overlays</a>.<br>
    </p>
    <h2><a id="Convert" name="Convert"></a>Converting Charts</h2>
    <p>As described you can run the conversion directly on the pi - but it will
      take time.</p>
    <p>It is potentially more appropriate to run the conversion on a desktop
      computer. You can do this on Linux or Windows machines. For the necessary
      installations see:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="install.html#Packages">Linux</a></li>
      <li><a href="install.html#Windows">Windows</a></li>
    </ul>
    The central part of the conversion will be handled by tile tools (<a href="https://code.google.com/p/tilers-tools/">https://code.google.com/p/tilers-tools/</a>)
    - a copy is included in AvNav.<br>
    On a desktop the charts will be created at
    &lt;UserHome&gt;/AvNavCharts/out&nbsp; (e.g.
    c:\Users\Andreas\AvNavCharts\out). In the UI you can select the output path.
    Normally one gemf file is created per run. The name is derived from the
    first selected input file or directory.<br>
    There will be a work directory within AvNavCharts - you should not delete
    this as it would speed up subsequent conversion runs (if you e.g. receive
    some corrective input charts).<br>
    The conversion consists of the steps:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>sorting the charts into layers (and potentially converting them)</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>creation of tiles</p>
      </li>
      <li>creation of the gemf file</li>
    </ul>
    <p>After creation of the gemf file just <a href="#installation">install</a>
      it on the pi.<br>
      You can also test the created chart directly on your desktop. The
      converter will invoke the AvNav server to which you connect by browser.</p>
    <h4><a name="windows" id="windows"></a>Windows</h4>
    <p>There is a <a href="install.html#Windows">Net-Installer</a>
      (AvNavNet...) for windows to install all the necessary software:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>python 2.7.10 (32 Bit)</li>
      <li>GDAL 1.11 for python 2.7 (32 Bit)</li>
      <li>Pillow 2.7.0</li>
      <li>pyserial 2.7</li>
    </ul>
    The installer will be installed within ProgramFiles\AvNav. If you uninstall
    AvNav just the installer will be removed.<br>
    All added components are installed in the user home diectory. They have to
    be uninstalled via the UI.<br>
    After installation you can start with AvChartConvert. <br>
    <br>
    There is just one screen:<br>
    <br>
    <img alt="windows gui" src="avnav-windows-new.png" width="800px"><br>
    <p>Click (1) to select the files/directories to convert. Click (2) to start
      the conversion process. The "view" button will display the logfile as the
      conversion proceeds. That's something you certainly like to see if
      something goes wrong.<br>
      Per default the AvNav server will automatically start up and invoke a
      browser after the conversion has finished.<br>
      If the necessary software has not yet been installed,&nbsp; a dialog is
      brought up to prompt if it should be installed right now. Clicking (5) you
      can repeat this step for an update. At (4) you can remove the downloaded
      software.<br>
      Some demo NMEA data are included in AvNav installation (southern baltic,
      Greifswalder Bodden), You may also use any other NMEA0183 file as input.<br>
      As the server on desktop computer is a fully featured AvNav you can also
      read NMEA data from connected devices, from bluetooth or IP. To meet
      special requirements you can even create your own avnav_server.xml and set
      up things there.</p>
    <p>This way it is also possible to use AvNav e.g. on a laptop on board. <br>
      If you only want to start up the server - click (3) "startServer". Has to
      be repeated after every configuration change.<br>
    </p>
    <h4>Linux</h4>
    As described at <a href="install.html#Packages">Installation</a> start up
    AvNav using avnav -g and select the charts you would like to convert.<br>
    <h4>Details</h4>
    Here are some details about the conversion steps. Normally you do care about
    them. You only need them if some of the default settings do not fit your
    needs.
    <blockquote>
      <div style="font-size:small">
        <p>The first step is fast. All chart data will be read, resolution and
          range will be detected. If necessary charts would be
          converted/reprojected. As a result there will be a chartlist.xml in
          workdir/&lt;name&gt; . The command line would be:</p>
        <pre>read_charts.py -g -o name -m chartlist inputdir [inputdir...]
</pre>
        <p>Afterwards you can check the chartlist.xml and you could e.g. move
          some charts into a different layer.</p>
        <p>The second step will take more time -&nbsp; now the tiles are
          created:</p>
        <pre>read_charts.py -g -o name -m generate inputdir [inputdir...]
</pre>
        <p>The file chartlist.xml must already exist at&nbsp;
          workdir/&lt;name&gt;. The creation will run multi threaded.</p>
        <p>At the end you need to create the gemf file:</p>
        <pre>read_charts.py -g -o name -m gemf inputdir [inputdir...]</pre>
        <p></p>
        <p>You could also combine all steps:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <pre>read_charts.py -g -m all [-o name] inputdir [inputdir...]

</pre> </blockquote>
      </div>

    <h3 class="western"><a id="Download" name="Download"></a></h3>
    <h2 class="western"><a name="mapproxy" id="mapproxy"></a>MapProxy plugin</h2>
    <p>A <a href="https://github.com/wellenvogel/avnav-mapproxy-plugin">plugin</a>
      is available to embed <a href="https://mapproxy.org/">MapProxy</a>,&nbsp;
      providing access to various online chart sources. The plugin will support
      you in configuring MapProxy and allows to comfortably download charts. For
      details refer to the <a href="https://github.com/wellenvogel/avnav-mapproxy-plugin/blob/master/Readme.md">plugin
        documentation</a>.</p>
    <p>The plugin offers a lot of functionality very similar to Mobile Atlas
      Creator and it can replace it in most cases.</p>
    <h3 class="western"></h3>
    <h2 class="western">Download using Mobile Atlas Creator</h2>
    <p>To use the <a href="https://mobac.sourceforge.io/">Mobile Atlas Creators</a>
      you only need Java and the MOBAC itself. It is important to follow a
      certain procedure when selecting the ranges for download&nbsp; in order to
      fit the charts to the described layer concept and to limit the amount of
      data. </p>
    <p>Typically, I recommend to use 3 layers: overview( zoom level 7-10),
      navigation (level 10-15), details (Level 16-18). Afterwards just proceed
      in MOBAC layer by layer. Select the zoom levels for the layer, select the
      areas you want and add them with an arbitrary name. Repeat this for all
      layers. Now save your selection using a meaningful name (the xml file
      could be reused later). Select OsmDroid GEMF (File-&gt;convertAtlasFormat)
      as output format and start atlas creation. In the output directory a
      xxx.gemf file will be created. <a href="#installation">Install</a> this
      on the pi. <br>
      At the <a href="mapsources.html">mapsources page</a> I present a
      collection of useful map sources.</p>
