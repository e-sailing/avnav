    <h1>User defined css</h1>
    <p>As the AvNav frontend is completely browser based (single page app with <a
        href="https://reactjs.org/">reactjs</a>) you can adapt its appearance
      with css.</p>
    <p>There is a file user.css intended to be used for your css rules. This
      file is located next to <a href="userjs.html">user.js</a> in
      BASEDIR/user/viewer. (BASEDIR is /home/pi/avnav/data on a pi).</p>
    <p>Via the Files/Download page <img src="../viewerimages/icons-new/ic_file_download.svg"
        alt="" class="inlineimage">and the subpage <img src="../viewerimages/icons-new/folder_shared.svg"
        alt="" class="inlineimage"> you can select the file to edit it.</p>
    <p><img src="../userdoc/downloadpage-user.png" alt="" class="fimage"> </p>
    <p>By clicking the file and selecting "Edit" in the dialog you can start the
      editor. During the first start a template has been created that already
      contains an example.</p>
    <p>Since Version 20210619 the name of the current layout is assigned as a
      CSS class to the application. All special characters will be replaced by
      "_". The layout user.default will become the CSS class user_default. Using
      this feature you can define different CSS for different layouts (e.g. for
      different devices).</p>
    <div class="code">.user_default .widget .COG {<br>  color: green;<br>}<br>.user_special .widget .COG {<br>  color: red;<br>}</div>
    <p>A proven workflow is the usage of your browser's developer tools (Chrome,
      Firefox,...), selecting the elements you would like to adapt and testing
      your changes.</p>
    <p>Afterwards you can directly copy the values to user.css and (after
      saving) test them by reloading the AvNav page.</p>
