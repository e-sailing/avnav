    <h1>Avnav Overlays</h1>
    <div class="toc"> </div>
    <p>Since version 20201219 AvNav is able to show additional information
      beside the chart itself in it's chart views. This could be waypoints from
      a GPX file or available tracks or other data (like e.g. current buoys
      from <a href="http://nautin.nl/wb/pages/navigatie/boeienbestanden/downloaden.php">nautin.nl</a>).</p>
    <p>Additionally you can show multiple charts on top of each other (e.g. an
      OpenSeamap chart that covers a wider range below an <a href="ocharts.html">o-charts</a>
      chart - or just multiple o-charts for different ranges).</p>
    <p>Within AvNav this is called Overlays.</p>
    <p>You can use the following types of data for overlays:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>GPX files (waypoints, tracks, routes)</li>
      <li><a href="https://developers.google.com/kml/documentation/kmzarchives">KML
          and KMZ</a> files (google) - inside the KMZ file you must have a
        doc.kml.</li>
      <li><a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoJSON">geojson</a> files</li>
      <li>other AvNav charts</li>
      <li>AvNav routes</li>
      <li>AvNav tracks</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For GPX and KML files you can provide user defined icons or e.g. html
      pages that can be accessed via link properties within a zip archive. KMZ
      files normally already contain such kinds of data.</p>
    <p>If you have such overlays visible on a chart you can obtain additional information by clicking on the symbol on the chart.</p>
    <h2><a name="configuration"></a>Configuration</h2>
    <p>Before you can start using overlays they need to be uploaded to AvNav.</p>
    <p><img src="DownloadPage-Overlays.png" alt="" class="fimage"></p>
    <p>Within AvNav the symbol <img src="../viewerimages/icons-new/layers-black.svg" alt="" class="inlineimage">is used for overlays.</p>
    <p>After you uploaded the files you can assign them to the available charts.
      You can define a set of overlays to be shown on every
      chart (default overlays). Additionally you can define per
      chart which overlays you would like to see on it.</p>
    <p>You can make those assignments either on the <a href="../userdoc/downloadpage.html">Files/Download
        page</a> at the sub section "charts" - or&nbsp; at the <a href="../userdoc/mainpage.html">Mainpage</a>.</p>
    <p><img src="Overlay-Config-Default-DownloadPage.png" alt="" class="fimage"></p>
    <p>In the screenshot&nbsp; you see the dialog showing up once you click on
      "DefaultOverlays" at the Files/Download page.</p>
    <p>In this dialog you can add, edit or remove overlays.</p>
    <p><img src="Overlay-Config-Default-Select1.png" alt="" class="fimage"></p>
    <p>In the screenshot you see the dialog that opens on clicking "InsertAfter".<br>
      In the example I selected the file Wegepunkte2020.gpx (<a href="https://nvcharts.com/shop/media/download/Wegepunkte2020_gpx.zip">NV
        Verlag</a>)&nbsp; that has been uploaded to the overlays directory.<br>
      You can now set various parameters (depending on the type of overlay).</p>
    <table width="100%" border="1">

          <td>You can select a zip file (that has been uploaded to overlays) containing symbol icons or other content (like html pages).<br>
            If there is a "sym" property within a gpx file (e.g. at a waypoint)
            - like sym="b1" AvNav will try to read a file b1.png from the
            provided zip file to display it at the position.<br>
            If a link property like link="data/1.html" is present, an entry data/1.html will be searched for within the zip file.<br>
            The same applies for KML files. Normally however, you better use KMZ files as they already contain all necessary data.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>

        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>If the overlay contains other data than way points, potentially
      more parameters can be displayed.</p>

    <table width="100%" border="1">

      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>After clicking "Ok" the overlay has been added.</p>
    <img src="Overlay-Config-Default-SelectList.png" alt="" class="fimage"><br>
    <p>You can change the overlay order by drag&amp;drop - if you want
      one below the chart you have to move it above the ---chart--- row.</p>
    <p>It could make sense to keep default overlays disabled first
      and just enable them on the charts where you really need them - or just on
      demand.</p>
    <p>For a chart the overlay configuration looks like:</p>
    <img src="Overlay-Config-Default-SelectListNormal.png" alt="" class="fimage">
    <p>Overlays configured as defaults can only be moved (as
      a block) or enabled/disabled. The overlays assigned explicitly to the
      chart can be edited.</p>
    <p>You can also access the overlay configuration page from the Mainpage via the <img src="../viewerimages/icons-new/layers-black.svg" alt="" class="inlineimage">button
      beside each chart.</p>
    <p><img src="Overlay-Config-Mainpage.png" alt="" class="fimage"></p>
    <p>The button on the right side will show the configuration for the default
      charts.</p>
    <p>For tracks and routes you can also invoke overlay configuration
      directly from a track (gpx file) or a route on the Files/Download page.</p>
    <p><img src="Overlay-Config-Track1.png" alt="" class="fimage"> </p>
    <p>In the picture you see the info dialog that pops up after clicking a gpx
      track. By selecting "Overlays" you can assign this track to charts (or
      remove it).</p>
    <p><img src="Overlay-Config-Track2.png" alt="" class="fimage"></p>
    <p>After deciding whether to assign it to the default
      overlays or to a particular chart, the normal overlay configuration dialog
      will pop up.</p>
    <p>If you select "Remove from Charts" this track will be removed from all
      overlays.</p>
    <br>
    <h2><a name="usage"></a>Usage</h2>
    <p>A chart selected for display will be shown together with
      the configured overlays.</p>
    <img src="Overlay-Example-Maps-Waypoints.png" alt="" class="fimage">
    <p>This example shows an o-charts chart together with an OpenStreetMap
      chart (below) and a waypoint file on top.<br>
      As default icon the --DefaultGpxIcon-- has been selected.<br>
      If you click one of the overlay's icons you will get its Feature Info
      dialog.</p>
    <img src="Overlay-Example-InfoDialog.png" alt="" class="fimage">
    <p>You will see the inforamtion available for this point and you can e.g.
      use this point as a routing target immediately (Goto).<br>
      Using "Hide" you can temporarily disable the complete overlay.<br>
      From within the <a href="../userdoc/editroutepage.html">Route
        Editor</a> some more functions are available at the info dialog.</p>
    <p><img src="Overlay-Example-InfoDialogRouting.png" alt="" class="fimage"></p>
    <p>The selected point can be added to the route (before or after the currently
      selected point) or you can move the currently selected waypoint to the
      position of the shown point.</p>
    <p>If the overlay is a route you can insert this route (starting from the
      selected point) into the current route. This way you can e.g. combine two
      routes.</p>
    <p><img src="Overlay-Example-InfoDialogRouting2.png" alt="" class="fimage"></p>
    <p>At the <a href="../userdoc/navpage.html">Navigation Page</a> and within the <a href="../userdoc/editroutepage.html">Route Editor</a> there is an
      option to temporarily disable or enable overlays.<br>
      This is done using the <img src="../viewerimages/icons-new/layers-black.svg" alt="" class="inlineimage">button on the right side.</p>
    <p><img src="Overlay-Config-ActiveOverlays.png" alt="" class="fimage"></p>
    <p>The enable and disable settings remain active until you change the chart.
      They are only valid for your current device (in contrary to all other
      overlay configuration functions that will always affect all connected
      devices as they are handled at the server).</p>
    <p>By clicking the Edit button you can enter the normal overlay
      configuration.</p>
    <p><b>Hint:</b></p>
    <p>Using overlay files with a lot of elements can seriously
      impact the display performance. There is currently no fixed limit for overlay file sizes. Files with several 100MB will for sure lead to
      problems - 1000 points within an overlay are ok.</p>
    <a name="adaptation"></a>
    <h2>Adaptations</h2>
    <p>Since version 20210114 you can adapt the information to be
      extracted from the overlay file and shown at "Feature Info". This
      could make sense as potentially overlay files contain information
      that otherwise cannot be handled by AvNav on its own.</p>
    <p>For this purpose you can set a "featureFormatter" function when you <a href="#configuration">configure</a>
      the overlay. This featureFormatter is a java script function, either
      already built in into AvNav or implemented by you in your <a href="userjs.html">user.js</a>&nbsp; It may also be provided by a <a href="plugins.html">plugin</a>.</p>
    <p>This java script function will retrieve all available parameters of the
      element from the overlay file that you have clicked on. It can return the properties to be shown in the "Feature Info" dialog.</p>
    <p>You can return the following properties:</p>
    <table width="100%" border="1">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>Name</td>
          <td>Meaning</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>sym</td>
          <td>The URL for an icon to be shown. This can be a relative URL
            referencing an icon file within the <a href="#configuration">configured</a>
            userIcons file. Alternatively it can be an absolute path like
            /user/images/myImage.png or an external url starting with http: or
            https: - this one can only be used with an existing internet
            connection, of course.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>name</td>
          <td>The name to be displayed</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>desc</td>
          <td>The text for the "description" field.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>htmlInfo</td>
          <td>A html string, that will be shown when clicking the <img src="../viewerimages/icons-new/ic_info.svg" alt="" class="inlineimage">Info button.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>time</td>
          <td>A time value (string or java script Date)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>link</td>
          <td>An URL, that will be shown when clicking the <img src="../viewerimages/icons-new/ic_info.svg" alt="" class="inlineimage">Info button (alternatively to
            htmlInfo). The same rules apply as for "sym".</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>The parameters retrieved by the function depend on the overlay file.
      Additionally you will always receive "lat" and "lon".</p>
    <p>An example for the <a href="https://github.com/wellenvogel/avnav/blob/master/viewer/util/featureFormatter.js">built
        in genericHtmlInfo</a> function retrieving all available
      parameters and writing them into the htmlInfo property as HTML.</p>
    <div class="code">let genericHtmlInfo=function(properties,extended){
    if (! extended) return {};
    let htmlInfo='&lt;div class="featureInfoHtml"&gt;';
    for (let k in properties){
        if (!properties[k]) continue;
        if (htmlInfo !== "") htmlInfo+="&lt;br/&gt;";
        htmlInfo+=avnav.api.escapeHtml(k)+"="+avnav.api.escapeHtml(properties[k]);
    }
    htmlInfo+='&lt;/div&gt;';
    return {htmlInfo:htmlInfo};
}</div>
    <p>The second parameter accepted by this function determines whether
      to compute all properties or only the "sym" property. If it is set to
      false you should not execute any time consuming operations, as this
      function will potentially be called for each of the overlay's elements.</p>
    <p>To let AvNav know about your own formatter function you need to register
      it (see <a href="userjs.html">user.js</a>).</p>
    <div class="code">avnav.api.registerFeatureFormatter('myHtmlInfo',myHtmlInfoFunction);</div>
    <p>After registration you can select this function in overlay <a href="#configuration">configuration</a>.<br>
