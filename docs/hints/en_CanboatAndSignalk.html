    <h1>Interworking with Canboat and SignalK</h1>
    <p>Starting with release 20200204 AvNav can interact with canboat
      (NMEA2000) and signalk.</p>
    <h2><a name="Canboat" id="Canboat"></a>Canboat (NMEA2000)</h2>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/canboat/canboat">Canboat</a> supports
      interfacing to NMEA 2000 bus systems using either a CAN adapter (e.g. <a href="https://www.reichelt.de/entwicklerboards-can-modul-mcp2515-mcp2562-debo-can-modul-p239277.html">MCP2515</a>
      or a <a href="https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/RS485_CAN_HAT">Waveshare
        RS485 CAN-HAT</a> ) or USB attached devices like the Actisene NGT-1. For
      simple adapters you need to ensure that they have 2 voltage supplies (3.3V
      and 5V) to be usable for the raspberry pi. Many of the simple ones do not
      have that!</p>
    <img title="Canboat" alt="" src="Canboat.png" width="800">
    <p>In the diagram the basic setup is shown as we provide it with the <a href="../install.html#Headless">headless
        images</a>. </p>
    <p>If you connect a <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=141052">CAN
        adapter</a> via <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/hardware/raspberrypi/spi/README.md">SPI</a>
      typically you need to enable an overlay in /boot/config.txt. Appropriate entries are prepared to use the
      MCP2515 and only need to be uncommented.
      Potentially you have to adjust the clock frequency and the GPIO pin used for the interrupt. Such can adapters are listed as network
      interface (probably they require configuration, but they are preconfigured in the images).<br>
      The interface should be visible with</p>
    <div class="code">ifconfig can0</div>
    <p>If you are planning to use an Actisense NGT-1 connected via USB refer to the
      <a href="https://github.com/canboat/canboat/wiki/actisense-serial">documentation
        at canboat</a>.</p>
    <p>AvNav is communicating with <a href="https://github.com/canboat/canboat/wiki/n2kd">n2kd</a>.
      This daemon converts incoming NMEA2000 data to NMEA0183 (although
      not completely). The configuration for n2kd is located at</p>
    <div class="code">/etc/default/n2kd</div>
    <p>Within our images this file predefines a connection to can0. If
      you are going to use an USB based adapter you have to modify this
      configuration.<br>
      In this case, please also add an entry in avnav_server.xml to exclude
      this adapter from auto detection (watch the AvNav status page while
      connecting the adapter - note its USB id and use it for the
      entry):</p>
    <div class="code">&lt;AVNUsbSerialReader .....&gt;<br>&lt;UsbDevice usbid="x:y.z" type="ignore"/&gt; <br>....</div>
    <p>When traffic is present on the NMEA 2000
      bus and if everything is setup correctly, you should see NMEA data /
      json data at ports 2599 and 2598. You can check this with</p>
    <div class="code">nc localhost 2599</div>
    <p>If you are unable to see data you can check the canboat status with</p>
    <div class="code">sudo systemctl status canboat</div>
    <p>There should be 2 connections between AvNav and n2kd (predefined in the
      images). AvNav receives NMEA0183 data on one connection (port 2599) and some of the json data on the other connection (port 2598).
      The latter is necessary as n2kd does not provide any NMEA0183 record
      containing a complete time stamp (like RMC). To get the data from NMEA2000
      AvNav directly decodes the pgns 126992 and 129029 to internally set
      date and time. It can also generate a RMC record internally (if
      valid position data is received via NMEA0183).</p>
    <p>To setup the connections following configuration settings are necessary within
      avnav_server.xml. Our images have them preconfigured, otherwise they can be copied &amp; pasted from the template at
      /usr/lib/avnav/raspberry/avnav_server.xml.</p>
    <div class="code">&lt;AVNSocketWriter port="34568" maxDevices="5" <br>   filter=""read="true" minTime="50" <br>   name="nmea0183tosignalk" <br>   blackList="canboatnmea0183,canboatgen"/&gt;
&lt;AVNSocketReader port="2599" host="localhost" filter="" name="canboatnmea0183"/&gt;
&lt;AVNPluginHandler&gt;<br>  &lt;builtin-canboat enabled="true" allowKeyOverwrite="true" autoSendRMC="30" sourceName="canboatgen"/&gt;<br>&lt;/AVNPluginHandler&gt;</div>
    <p>The first entry defines an additional output port for AvNav.
      This port provides all received/created NMEA 0183 data - excluding data received from canboat. This port is used for SignalK integration. Canboat data are omitted as signalk directly reads data from
      the NMEA 2000 bus.</p>
    <p>The SocketReader at localhost:2599 reads NMEA0183 data from
      n2kd.</p>
    <p>Direct reading of NMEA2000 data from n2kd is handled by a plugin.
      Therefore an entry has to be created in AVNPluginHandler. The
      settings as in above example activate the plugin.&nbsp;
      allowKeyOverwrite permits the plugin to set date and time.&nbsp; autoSendRMC=30 will advise AvNav to send out a RMC record every one second
      (if no other RMC records are seen within 30 seconds). For further explanation of the
      plugin parameters refer to the <a href="https://github.com/wellenvogel/avnav/blob/master/server/plugins/canboat/plugin.py">source
        code</a>.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>AvNav is currently not prepared to output data to NMEA2000. If this is
      required, you can handle this via signalk.</p>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <h2><a name="SignalK" id="SignalK"></a>SignalK</h2>
    <p>Starting from 20200204 a first step of interacting with <a href="http://signalk.org/">SignalK</a>
      is possible.</p>
    <img alt="SignalK" src="SignalK.png" width="800">
    <p>In the set up as predifined in the images, all NMEA0183 data
      received by AvNav are sent to SignalK, the only exception being data
      received from canboat. On the SignalK side an
      appropriate channel must be configured (predefined in the images as well). On
      AvNav side the port is 34568 (see above).</p>
    <p>If you are using AvNav on OpenPlotter the data flow will be different.
      NMEA0183 are all read directly by SignalK and only from there they
      will be routed to AvNav. In this case you should not configure any NMEA0183 input
      devices in AvNav.</p>
    <p>To receive data from SignalK AvNav is polling (default: once per second) the URL</p>
    <div class="code">http://localhost:3000/signalk/v1/api/vessels/self</div>
    <p>All SignalK "value" entries are stored internally with prefix</p>
    <div class="code">gps.signalk....</div>
    <p>Since Version 20201202 an additional websocket connection is implemented to accelerate reception of deltas. Polling will still take place, at a much reduced rate however (10s).</p>
    <p>By this integration all data are available to the app and can be displayed in
      widgtes. A ready to go <a href="https://github.com/wellenvogel/avnav/blob/master/server/plugins/signalk/example.json">layout</a>
      is available and you can adapt this one - or create your own - via the <a href="layouts.html">layout
        editor</a>.&nbsp; You can select the layout on the <a href="../userdoc/settingspage.html">settings
        page</a>&nbsp; (system.plugin.builtin-signalk.example) - it will only be
      visible if the signalk plugin is enabled.</p>
    <p>Fetching data from SignalK is handled by a plugin which has to be
      configured. The images already contain the valid configuration, otherwise, as usual,
      you will find it at the template
      /usr/lib/avnav/raspberry/avnav_server.xml:</p>
    <div class="code">&lt;AVNSocketWriter port="34568" maxDevices="5" filter="" read="true" minTime="50" name="nmea0183tosignalk" blackList="canboatnmea0183,canboatgen"/&gt;
&lt;AVNPluginHandler&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;builtin-signalk enabled="true"/&gt;
&lt;/AVNPluginHandler&gt;</div>
    <p>If you also use the canboat integration make sure to configure both plugins within a single AVNPluginHandler entry.<br>
      As SignalK receives all NMEA0183 data, any active waypoint would be
      visible there (sent via $RMB).<br>
      If the plugin is enabled a <a href="../userdoc/addonpage.html">user app</a>
      entry for SignalK will be visible in the Web UI.</p>
    <p>In principle you could also setup other configurations (e.g. AvNav receives all NMEA data from SignalK and only sends RMB). Such a setup will be used in OpenPlotter. In any case be
      careful not to create any loops. You can use AvNav's SocketReader filter and&nbsp; name options, as well as the writer's filter,
      readFilter and blackList options. In this environment you could also handle canboat integration via SignalK.</p>
    <p>The following plugin parameters are available:</p>

    <h3><a name="SignalKCharts" id="SignalKCharts"></a>SignalK - Charts</h3>
    <p>Since version 202011xx an integration of the <a href="https://github.com/SignalK/charts-plugin">SignalK
        chart provider</a> is available. Charts provided by SignalK can be
      selected on the main page. You have to enable the chart
      provider plugin within SignalK and configure/upload charts.</p>
    <p>Normally AvNav will just provide the information about these charts, the
      browser will directly access SignalK to load the chart tiles.</p>
    <p>If this is blocked (e.g. by firewall rules) you can
      proxy all chart tile requests via AvNav. </p>
    <p>The plugin brings along some new parameters to handle the SignalK charts.
      Normally you can leave them at their defaults.</p>
