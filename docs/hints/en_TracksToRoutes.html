    <h1>Converting Tracks to Routes</h1>
    <div class="toc"> </div>
    <p>AvNav continously records <a href="../quickstart.html#tracks">tracks</a>. A new track file (gpx) is generated every day.</p>
    <p>Those tracks (or tracks uploaded via <a href="../userdoc/downloadpage.html">Files/Download</a>
      page) can be converted to routes to be used in navigation.</p>
    <h2>Concept</h2>
    <p>This conversion typically requires to reduce the number of points in
      the track as they often contain more than 1000 points. Otherwise using such a
      route is unfeasible.</p>
    <p>AvNav is using an algorithm similar to <a href="https://www.gpsbabel.org/htmldoc-development/filter_simplify.html">GPS
        Babel</a>. One by one, points with
      smallest distance from the vector between the two neighboring
      points are eliminated.</p>
    <p>You can provide a parameter (Xte) to define the maximum tolerable distance. The
      larger distance you allow, the fewer points the created route will contain.
      For usabilty reasons, you should try to keep your routes below 50 waypoints.</p>
    <p>After the conversion you can fine tune the route in the <a href="../userdoc/editroutepage.html">Route-Editor</a>.</p>
    <h2>Handling</h2>
    <p>You enter the conversion dialog either from the Files/Download page
      from within the <a href="../userdoc/downloadpage.html#tracks">Track Info
        Dialog</a> (<img src="../viewerimages/icons-new/route.svg" alt="" class="inlineimage">Convert
      Button) or from the info dialog if you have the track selected as an <a href="overlays.html#usage">Overlay</a>
      on the chart and click on a point within it. Again, you press the&nbsp; <img
        src="../viewerimages/icons-new/route.svg" alt="" class="inlineimage">Convert
      Button - see picture.</p>

    <p>After clicking "Convert" the conversion dialog pops up.</p>
    <img src="TracksToRoutes1.png" alt="" class="fimage">
    <p>Normally (as in the picture) you will see a warning about point
      count exceeding 50.</p>
    <p>Using "max Xte" you configure the converter and start the conversion
      clicking "Compute". If the number of points still does not fit you can try
      again with a different Xte.</p>
    <img src="TracksToRoutes2.png" alt="" class="fimage">
    <p>In above example a max Xte of 22m produced a good route.</p>
    <p>Within the dialog you can change the name for the new route (and
      decide to potentially overwrite an existing one with the same name).</p>
    <p>After saving you can directly start editing the route.</p>

    <p>At this point you preferrably had the track displayed as an overlay to the chart,
      so you can easily check if all the important track waypoints are included in the route.</p>
