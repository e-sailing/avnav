    <p>All addresses that can be used to connect to AvNav are shown here. In
      normal setups (i.e. AvNav is working as an access point and you are using
      the avnav wifi) the relevant addresses start with 192.168....<br>
      If you additionally configured an <a href="wpapage.html">external wifi
        connection</a> this network's address will be displayed as well.</p>
    <p>By scanning the QR code with another devices you can easily connect to
      the AvNav server. You only have to choose the correct address
      for you - depending on the network you are connected to.</p>
    <p>This way to connect is an alternative to the variants described in the
      <a href="index.html">Introduction</a>. </p>
